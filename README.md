# Statistical Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains three projects developed as part of a Statistical Data Analysis course.  
Each project focuses on a different core methodology used in data science and applied statistics.

The projects are implemented in Python using standard scientific libraries and are documented through Jupyter notebooks and accompanying reports.
